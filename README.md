# Streaming Pipelines
Homework for Week 5 Streaming Pipelines

## Submission Guidelines

To ensure smooth processing of your submissions through GitHub Classroom automation, we cannot accommodate individual requests for changes. Therefore, please read all instructions carefully.

1. **Sync fork:** Ensure your fork is up-to-date with the upstream repository. You can do this through the GitHub UI or by running the following commands in your local forked repository:
    ```bash
    git pull upstream main --rebase
    git push origin <main/your_homework_repo> -f
    ```
2. **Open a PR in the upstream repository to submit your work:**
    - Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge changes from your `main` or custom `homework` branch in your forked repository into the main branch in the upstream repository, i.e., the repository your fork was created from.
    - Ensure your PR is opened correctly to trigger the GitHub workflow. Submitting to the wrong branch or repository will cause the GitHub action to fail.
    - See the [Steps to open a PR](#steps-to-open-a-pr) section below if you need help with this.
3. **Complete assignment prompts:** Write your query files corresponding to the prompt number in the **`submission`** folder. Do not change or rename these files!
4. **Lint your SQL code for readability.** Ensure your code is clean and easy to follow.
5. **Add comments to your queries.** Use the **`--`** syntax to explain each step and help the reviewer understand your thought process. 

A link to your PR will be shared with our TA team after the homework deadline.

### Steps to open a PR
  1. Go to the upstream [**`streaming-pipelines`**](https://github.com/DataExpert-ZachWilson-V4/streaming-pipelines) repository
  2. Click the [**Pull Requests**](https://github.com/DataExpert-ZachWilson-V4/streaming-pipelines/pulls) tab.
  3. Click the **"New pull request"** button on the top-right. This will take you to the [**"Compare changes"**](https://github.com/DataExpert-ZachWilson-V4/streaming-pipelines/compare) page.
  4. Click the **"compare across forks"** link in the text.
  5. Leave the base repository as is. For the **"head repository"**, select your forked repository and then the name of the branch you want to compare from your forked repo.
  6. Click the **"Create pull request"** button to open the PR

### Grading
  - Grades are pass or fail, used solely for certification.
  - Final grades will be submitted by a TA **after the deadline**.
  - An approved PR means a Pass grade. If changes are requested, the grade will be marked as Fail.
  - Reviewers may provide comments or suggestions with requested changes. These are optional and intended for your benefit. Any changes you make in response will not be re-reviewed.

Assignment
==================

Your task is to write a streaming pipeline to understand DataExpert.io user behavior using sessionization. 
Use the `glue_job_runner.py` connectors and examples in the [airflow-dbt-project](https://github.com/DataExpert-io/airflow-dbt-project) repo to get started. Copy and paste the DDL into `submission/session_ddl.sql` and copy the job into `submission/session_job.py`!

## Assignment Tasks

- Write a DDL query (`session_ddl.sql`) that creates a table that tracks Data Expert sessions. 
  - Make sure to have a unique identifier for each session
  - the start and end of the session
  - a unique identifier for the session
  - how many events happened in that session
  - the date of the beginning of the session
  - What city, country, and state is associated with this session
  - What operating system and browser are associated with this session
  - Whether this session is for logged in or logged out users

  
- Write a Spark Streaming Job (`session_job.py`) that reads from Kafka
  - It groups the Kafka events with a `session_window` with a 5-minute gap (sessions end after 5 minutes of inactivity)
    - It is also grouped by `user_id` and `ip` to track each user behavior
  - Make sure to increase the `timeout` of your job to `1 hour` so you can capture real sessions
  - Create a unique identifier for each session called `session_id` (you should think about using `hash` and the necessary columns to uniquely identify the session)
  - If `user_id` is not null, that means the event is from a logged in user
  - If a user logs in, that creates a new session (if you group by `ip` and `user_id` that solves the problem pretty elegantly)
